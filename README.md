## Description
This project is a very simple web application that calculates the one rep max of a weight-lifting
exercise based on the Brzycki formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum).  

Though the application itself is simple, the main purpose of this project is to implement 
a Continuous Deployment Pipeline with `pytest` test automation, `Docker`, and `Github Actions`.
